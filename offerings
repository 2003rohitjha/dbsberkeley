        <h2>General Membership</h2>
        <p>
            General members will have access to open advising and workshops facilitated by DBS. The Diverse Business Society will help general members from marginalized backgrounds receive the mentorship and resources necessary to receive job offers in positions that will launch their careers. This includes weekly workshops on topics such as resume building and technical and behavioral interviews. We also facilitate these students' admission to the well-resourced campus organizations that they are historically excluded from such consulting and business clubs.
