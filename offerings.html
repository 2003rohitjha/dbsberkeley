        <h2>General Membership</h2>
        <p>
            General members will have access to open advising and workshops facilitated by DBS. The Diverse Business Society will help general members from marginalized
            backgrounds receive the mentorship and resources necessary to receive job offers in positions
            that will launch their careers. This includes weekly workshops on topics such as resume building and technical and behavioral interviews. We also facilitate these students’ admission to the well-resourced campus organizations that they are historically excluded from such consulting and business clubs.

        <h2>Career Development Program</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="right-content">
        Our Career Development Program runs every semester and trains students on Consulting, Tech, and Finance recruiting. Our program consists of a weekly workshop along with assignments and mock interviews to help students prepare to get internships and full-time offers at top firms. Our workshops are led by mentors and speakers who work at renowned firms and understand how to help students navigate these traditionally restricted spaces. <br><br>

        Our goal for our professional development program is to provide a resource where students can come and receive the support and guidance necessary to break into these prestigious and selective careers. Additionally, we will be providing a club assistance program where students within leadership positions at Berkeley’s business organizations will have the opportunity to assist students in one-on-one sessions and workshops to allow them to break into these selective and extremely well-resourced organizations. <br><br>
        
        General members may be a part of the Career Development Program by submitting a CDP Application.
